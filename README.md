# Help Desk Ticket Generation using UiPath

Help desk agents get inputs from a variety of channels, including phone, email, and spreadsheets, to create and update support tickets. Support tickets are the requests that you raise by calling help desk agents to get your issues resolved;

we will only be covering the automation of inputting tickets from spreadsheets that a requester places in a certain folder.

The bot, once invoked(attended automation) , automatically creates a support ticket within the help desk system for you.
